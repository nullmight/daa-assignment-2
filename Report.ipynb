    "We converted the pseudocode as discussed in class and made helper functions wherever required. We tried various penalties (C) for adding new lines and observed the changes in the resulting line segments for every set of points. Increasing the value of C led to fewer line segments in the results and vice-versa. While finding the best fit line for a set of points using the closed form solution, we encountered some test cases where the denominator was becoming 0. To avoid division by 0, we added a small epsilon value (1e-8) to the denominator. This solved the error and we got the expected results."
